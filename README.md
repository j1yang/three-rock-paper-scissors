<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

- The Three.js Rock Paper Scissors Simulation is inspired by the classic 2D Rock Paper Scissors game, but with a 3D twist. 

- In this simulation, three-dimensional sphere of rock, paper, and scissors are placed in a container and made to collide with each other. Each collision is randomized with values such as speed and direction, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.

### Key Features

- 3D version of Rock Paper Scissors
- Dynamic collision simulation with randomized values
- Custom physics
